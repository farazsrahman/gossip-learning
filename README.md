## Log:

TODO:
- See oracle performance over time on a couple simple topologies
- See how parameter averaging compares to embedding averaging 
- Validate agent encoder itself on far away agent's task to see if they pick up the representation
- See training speed without recieving neighbor updates vs. with receiving neighbor updates.

April 20th 
- Create agent class with encoder, decoder architecture. (DONE)
- Test with two agents, on a single-task toy data (DONE)
- Create Oracle validation loop (DONE)
